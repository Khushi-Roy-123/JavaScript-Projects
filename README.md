# JavaScript Projects 🚀

This repository contains my collection of JavaScript projects – both mini and major – created while learning and building. These projects help me understand core JavaScript concepts and improve my web development skills.

## 📂 Project Categories

- **Mini Projects** – Small, concept-based apps (e.g., ToDo App, Calculator, Clock, Number Predicting Game)
- **Major Projects** – Full-fledged apps with UI and logic (e.g., Spotify Clone, Weather App)

## 🚧 Work in Progress
Stay tuned as I keep adding more projects from my learning journey 🚀
